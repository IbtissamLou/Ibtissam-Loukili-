# Hi — I’m Ibtissam Loukili 👋
**Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer**  
Based in Palaiseau, France · Open to Data Scientist roles starting **September 2025**

I build end-to-end ML systems (from data engineering and modeling to deployment and monitoring). I enjoy applied ML for time series, energy systems, and production-ready MLOps pipelines.
