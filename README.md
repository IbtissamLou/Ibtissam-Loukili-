# Hi — I’m Ibtissam Loukili 👋
**Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer**  
Based in ILE-DE-FRANCE, France · Open to Data Scientist roles starting **October 2025**

- I build end-to-end ML systems (from data engineering and modeling to deployment and monitoring). I enjoy applying machine learning to create data-driven solutions across different sectors, and I’m curious about exploring diverse real-world applications.
